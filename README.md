Main Overview:
In this technical assignment, I was taught what different types of repositories there were and how to interact with them. This assignment gave me hands on practice with GitHub, Python, and creating a web server.

Tutorial 1 - Git
In this tutorial, I was given the tools to download the git bash or the GitHub desktop application. I was told that GitHub is a place where remote repositories live and our computers store code and files on the local repository. Using git bash, I was able to clone, initiate, and link local and remote repositories through my terminal. By the end of this tutorial, I was able to communicate between my local and remote repository.

Tutorial 2 - Python Install and Setup
In this part of the technical assignment, I learned about virtual environments and global environments and why they're important. I installed Anaconda, created a virtual environment, and now use it when installing packages. Next I installed an IDE (VS Code) and tried PyCharm out. The purpose of this tutorial was to setup my hardware to be able to build and run customizable software and enable software creation on my machines.

Tutorial 3 - Python Basics
In this tutorial, I was taught about the basics of Python. I was taught about lists [], dictionaries {}, list comprehensions, tuples (), array slicing, how to comment, how to use string methods, how to create a function, and some Python key words.

Tutorial 4 - Web Serving with FastAPI
In this tutorial, the purpose was to teach about how the FastAPI packaging could enable us to create a local host. This tutorial involved creating an HTML file that represented the web page and a Python file that creates and enables the server while it's being ran. 

Challenge 1 - Python Review


Challenge 2 - Web Serving Review
In this challenge I created an HTML file and programmed for a web page. In the end, I added headers of different types, a title tag, paragraphs, and a picture.
