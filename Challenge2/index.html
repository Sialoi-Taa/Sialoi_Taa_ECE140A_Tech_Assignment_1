    <h2>Projects and Experiences</h2>
      <h3>Internship At Forza Innovations</h3>
        <p>
          I was an intern at the start up Forza Innovations and the title I held there was assistant electrical engineer. My duties were to assistant the main engineer with anything they needed help with such as circuit building, microcontroller programming, soldering, etc. I was there for 2 months during summer vacation. Looking back on it, there were a lot of people there that made my time there a postive experience and gave me a lot of long time benefits related to engineering.

    <h3>Building A Modified Smartwatch For UCSD's QL+</h3>
    <p>There's a student org called "QL+". Which stands for Quality Life Improvement. This org focuses on the needs of San Diegans who have some disability or special needs and tries to help them improve their daily lives through the inventions of its org members. The duty I have on the Smart Watch team is coding and circuit proofing. I collaborate with a computer engineer and we both build circuits and write code for the smart watch. I've been in that club from Sophomore year to present and looking back, it has been a positive but challenging experience that's forced me to grow. It was through this club's project showcase that I was able to gain my first internship.</p>
    <h3>Simon Says On Arduino</h3>
    <p>In this experience, I think it shows my creativity and my problem solving capabilities. During ECE 5 I was tasked to create something reflective of what was taught during the quarter and the thing I decided to recreate was the game Simon Says. I used the Arduino given to me by the school and programmed it with the materials that was taught in class. I created the circuit and code by myself and it worked after a few days of work. This took around 3 days to make with adding memory, modes, modulating speed as the user gained more and more progress, and I used the serial window to keep track of the level and whether the person lost or not. Looking back, this was a great experience because it gave me my first hands on experience in product development.</p>
